## Woo hoo I'm up and running

Hope this is a start to one of my more fruitful enterprises. This is going to be a stage to capture my thoughts on software engineering and computer science.

Shout out to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for the [amazing article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) in Smashing Magazine which helped me get started and Minimal Mistakes [https://mmistakes.github.io/](https://mmistakes.github.io/) for providing the theme.

Finally I will leave you with some of the tech blogs which have inspired me over the years. Spoiler Alert !!! I am going to rip them off unabashedly :P.
